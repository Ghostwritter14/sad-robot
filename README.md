# SAD ROBOT 

### This application was made during a period where I had nothing to do and was waiting to join my job at Gallagher.

##### This application is about a sad robot who needs your help to become cheerful of life. the application weighs the polarity of sentences and phrases to give points. You get 10 points for a neutral response. 20 for a positive one and -20 for negetive. If the meter reaches -30 you loose. If you can score 100 points you win.
